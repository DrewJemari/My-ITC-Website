        <h1>Environmental Resources in the Philippines</h1>
        <p><i>The Philippines is an archipelago of over 7,000 islands, each with its unique ecosystems and natural resources. These resources 
            play a vital role in the lives of Filipinos, providing food, water, shelter, and economic opportunities. However, these resources 
            are under increasing pressure from population growth, urbanization, and climate change. It is important to manage these resources 
            sustainably to ensure that they continue to benefit future generations.</i></p>

        <h2>Forest Resources</h2> <a href="index1.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines is home to a rich diversity of forests, covering approximately 24% of the country's land area. These forests are 
            critical for biodiversity conservation, watershed protection, and climate change mitigation. They also provide valuable timber and 
            non-timber forest products, such as rattan, bamboo, and medicinal plants.</p>
        
        <h2>Mineral Resources</h2> <a href="index2.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines is endowed with abundant mineral resources, including gold, copper, nickel, chromite, and iron ore. These minerals 
            are essential for the manufacturing and construction industries. However, mining activities can also have negative environmental 
            impacts, such as pollution and deforestation.</p>

        <h2>Water Resources</h2> <a href="index3.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines has abundant water resources, with over 420 major river basins and thousands of smaller streams and lakes. These 
            resources are essential for agriculture, domestic use, and hydropower generation. However, water pollution and overexploitation 
            are significant threats to the country's water resources.</p>

        <h2>Marine Resources</h2> <a href="index4.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines is surrounded by vast oceans, giving it access to a wealth of marine resources, including fish, shellfish, seaweed, 
            and coral reefs. These resources are vital for the livelihoods of many Filipinos, providing food, income, and employment. However, 
            overfishing and destructive fishing practices are threatening the sustainability of these resources.</p>
    
        <h2>Agricultural Resources</h2> <a href="index5.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines is a major agricultural producer, with fertile lands that support a wide variety of crops, including rice, corn, 
            coconuts, bananas, sugarcane, and mangoes. Agriculture is a major source of employment and income in the Philippines. However, 
            agricultural practices can also have negative environmental impacts, such as soil erosion and pesticide pollution.</p>

        <h2>Renewable Energy Resources</h2> <a href="index6.html" title="Click for more Info"><button><u><i>See More</i></u></button></a>
        <p>The Philippines has a wealth of renewable energy resources, including geothermal, solar, and wind power. These resources can help 
            to reduce the country's reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the impacts of climate change.</p>
